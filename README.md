Simple GUI project that I made using QtDesigner to generate the UI, then translated the program using PyQt4 and implemented the scraping funcions utilizing the pytube module.

The program runs on Linux and is not implemented on another OS yet, you need to have some version of QT installed for it to run. 

Just type the youtube video url you wish to download.

You have the option to download just the audio file if you wish.

Once the download is completed a message will tell you the download was successfull.
